This project is a part of The Odin Projects Curriculum. The purpose is to create a clock that mirrors the "Pomodor Technique". Where you work in cycles consisting of 25 minutes of work followed by 5 Minute Breaks. I will be using HTML JS and CSS to Complete this project.

RESULTS:
I am not sure if I went about this the same way that the other students did. For the sake of simplicity and asthetic I like how it turned out. There is a fair amount of dom manipulation being done and if I had more time I would make the free time notifications do some more fun things.
